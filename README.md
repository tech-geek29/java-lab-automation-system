# java-lab-automation-system
A java socket programming based application that automates the work of any computer labs.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to give a platform for lab automation which would cater the needs of students and teachers on an intranet to let admin control and restrict the specific activities. Attendance can be done just by Logging in. It provides a common platform to all users in a lab to share important lab files/manuals with access only as provided by admin. It will notify the admin if a pendrive is plugged in/out by the user. The project is very easy to use, enabling even a novice person to use it.

# Scope
This Document plays a vital role in the development life cycle (SDLC) as it describes the complete requirement of the system. It is meant for use by the developers and will be the basic during testing phase.

# Deliverables
An interface capable of:
1. Server System Application
2. Client System Application

# Knowledge Areas Needed for Project
1. Software Engineering
2. Java Programming Language
3. Knowledge of Socket Programming concepts such as Socket, Connection establishment etc.

# Product Perspective
The Application will be a self-contained and independent software product.

# Product Functions
The System will allow access only to authorized users with specific role. Depending upon the user’s role he/she will be able to access only specific module of the system.
1. ATTENDANCE – Details of the students present in the lab are submitted automatically.
2. SHARING RESOURCES- The admin can share the resources with multiple clients using this module.
3. SUBMITTING RESOURCES- The clients can submit their resources to admin(if required).
4. Downloading attachments.
5. USB activities can be monitored.
6. Sleep/Shutdown of the client machine can be controlled by the server.
7. Internet can be disabled/enabled by the faculty.

# User Characteristics
Users have elementary computer knowledge and the knowledge of how to use the Application.

# General Constraints
The admin’s IP address and port no. is required. The attachments or messages will be send to particular admin by the client or to all the clients by the admin.

# Assumptions and Dependencies
LAN connection between desired devices.
